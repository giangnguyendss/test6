-- Databricks SQL script: Test data generation for d_product table data quality checks
-- Purpose: Generate comprehensive test data for d_product table to validate data quality logic
-- Author: Giang Nguyen
-- Date: 2025-08-03
-- Description: This script creates a CTE with diverse test records for the d_product table, covering happy path, edge cases, error cases, NULL handling, and special/multibyte characters. Data types and formats strictly follow Databricks conventions and the provided schema.

-- CTE: Generate 28 diverse test records for d_product table
-- Covers: valid data, NULLs, invalid prod_exp_dt (pattern and calendar), special/multibyte chars, edge numeric values
